- 😶‍🌫️ Hi, I’m @OffGridTechClub
- 🤖 I’m interested in Creating an OP25 mobile Raspberry Pi Digital Trunked Police Scanner based off of OP25. This will include an i2c display screen that shows which talk group, talk ID, and frequency are currently broadcasting. Buttons and a rotary encoder will control the volume and other functions such as changing channels, up / down, safe shutdown, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, JSON, JavaScript, and some Go
- 🕵🏼‍♂️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool projects involving Raspberry Pi hardware
